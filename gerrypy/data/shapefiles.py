"""This script downloads shapefiles from all 50 states and American territories
 from the TIGER census geospatial database. Shapefiles are saved in a folder
based on their respective state codes as defined by:

Simply run <python get_shapefile.py> in the directory you wish to store
these shapefiles and change the year as appropriate.

Saves data in shapes/STATE_year."""
